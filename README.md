## Clustering Method to infer 3D shape (adapted from What3D)  
  
  What3D paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03678   
  What3D dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OmL-EFCB-I_YhvvZ_DHRpLbFYg0vYf8G

  Implemented the Clustering method based on the cluster assignment given by What3D author  
  To run the script, place the *dataset* folder What3D outside of *clustering*  
  ```bash
  cd model
  python clustering.py
  ```
